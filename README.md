TLMetaResolver is an extension to UIWebView writen in Swift that adds the ability to parse the meta tags in the loaded web page and extract information about a native app that can be deep linked from that page. This method is used for Twitter and Facebook to deep link to a native app from a posted web page. The meta tags definitions handled for TLMetaResolver are:

- [Twitter App Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/app)
- [Facebook App Link](http://applinks.org/documentation/)
- [Apple Smart Banner](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html)

## How it work

TLMetaResolver adds a funtion to UIWebView that evaluate a JavaScript script in the context of the loaded web page. This script returns an _app id_ and _url_. The _app id_ is the id of the native app on iTunes, the _url_ is a special url used to fire the native app.

With the _app id_ the extension perform a search on iTunes calling the [iTunes Search API](https://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html) to get the app name and icon url. Then the icon image is downloaded and a TLNativeAppActivity is created and returned to be presented in a UIActivityViewController. When the activity is performed a call to ``UIApplication.sharedApplication().openURL()`` is made with the url pointing to the native app.

## Usage

To use this code you should call one of the ``resolveMetaTags()`` functions once your page is loaded and provide a closure conforming the ``TLMetaResolverComplete`` type. Check the example project for a possible implementation, you can ``pod try TLMetaResolver``.

One key point to remember is that ``webViewDidFinishLoad`` function of UIWebViewDelegate can be called many times so you should handle that case to avoid unnecesary calls to ``resolveMetaTags()``. The extension don't have any check at this level

There are two version of ``resolveMetaTags()`` that have slightly different parameters:

```swift
func resolveMetaTags (onComplete: TLMetaResolverComplete)
```

Both versions has a parameter of type ``TLMetaResolvercomplete`` that is a callback that is fired when the process finish.

```swift
func resolveMetaTags (fetchUrl: TLMetaResolverFetchURL?, _ fetchImage: TLMetaResolverFetchURL?, _ onComplete: TLMetaResolverComplete)
```

The long version has two extra parameters that are closures used to issue the requests to iTunes Search API  (``fetchUrl``)  and the app icon download (``fetchImage``). You can provide the implementation for one of this, both or none (that is the case of the short version of ``resolverMetaTags()``). For the closures you don't provide a default implementation is provided using ``NSURLSession.sharedSession()``.

## Installation

TLMetaResolver is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "TLMetaResolver"

You can also do a quick check with:

    pod try TLMetaResolver

Keep in mind that the Swift support in CocoaPods is in beta. If you want to try TLMetaResolver with CocoaPods first install the last beta for the version 0.36 (at the time of writing this the last one is 0.36.beta.2) with ``sudo gem install cocoapods --pre``. [This blog post](http://iosdevbits.blogspot.com/2014/12/finally-cocoapods-with-swift.html) can be usefull if you have any problem, for a complete explanation check the [Pod Authors Guide to CocoaPods Frameworks](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Pod-Authors-Guide-to-CocoaPods-Frameworks/).

Or opt to clone the repo and integrate the code and assets under the Pod/ directory to your project as you like.
